Modify file and directory access control lists (ACLs)

  -b, --remove-all       remove all extended ACL entries
  -x, --delete           delete one or more specified ACL entries
  -f, --set-file         set ACL entries for FILE to ACL entries read
                         from ACL_FILE
  -k, --remove-default   remove all default ACL entries
  -m, --modify           modify one or more specified ACL entries
  -n, --no-mask          don't recalculate the effective rights mask
      --mask             do recalculate the effective rights mask
  -s, --set              set specified ACL entries on FILE
  -V, --version          print version and exit
  -h, --help             this help text

At least one of (-b, -x, -f, -k, -m, -s) must be specified

  Acl_entries are one or more comma-separated ACL entries from the following
  list:

    u[ser]::perm
    u[ser]:uid:perm
    g[roup]::perm
    g[roup]:gid:perm
    m[ask]:[:]perm
    o[ther]:[:]perm

  Default entries are like the above with the additional default identifier.
  For example:

    d[efault]:u[ser]:uid:perm

  'perm' is either a 3-char permissions string in the form "rwx" with the
  character - for no permission, or it is the octal representation of the
  permissions, a value from 0 (equivalent to "---") to 7 ("rwx").
  'uid' is a user name or a numerical uid.
  'gid' is a group name or a numerical gid.

For each file given as parameter, setfacl will either replace its complete ACL
(-s, -f), or it will add, modify, or delete ACL entries.

The following options are supported:

-b, --remove-all
  Remove all extended ACL entries.  The base ACL entries of the owner, group
  and others are retained.  This option can be combined with the
  -k,--remove-default option to delete all non-standard POSIX permissions.

-x, --delete
  Delete one or more specified entries from the file's ACL.  The owner, group
  and others entries must not be deleted.  Acl_entries to be deleted should
  be specified without permissions, as in the following list:

    u[ser]:uid[:]
    g[roup]:gid[:]
    m[ask][:]
    d[efault]:u[ser][:uid]
    d[efault]:g[roup][:gid]
    d[efault]:m[ask][:]
    d[efault]:o[ther][:]

-f, --set-file
  Take the Acl_entries from ACL_FILE one per line.  Whitespace characters are
  ignored, and the character "#" may be used to start a comment.  The special
  filename "-" indicates reading from stdin.
  Required entries are
  - One user entry for the owner of the file.
  - One group entry for the group of the file.
  - One other entry.
  If additional user and group entries are given:
  - A mask entry for the file group class of the file.
  - No duplicate user or group entries with the same uid/gid.
  If it is a directory:
  - One default user entry for the owner of the file.
  - One default group entry for the group of the file.
  - One default mask entry for the file group class.
  - One default other entry.

-k, --remove-default
  Remove all default ACL entries. If no default ACL entries exist, no
  warnings are issued.  This option can be combined with the -b,--remove-all
  option to delete all non-standard POSIX permissions.

-m, --modify
  Add or modify one or more specified ACL entries.  Acl_entries is a
  comma-separated list of entries from the same list as above.

-n, --no-mask
  Valid in conjunction with -m.  Do not recalculate the effective rights
  mask. The default behavior of setfacl is to recalculate the ACL mask entry,
  unless a mask entry was explicitly given.  The mask entry is set to the
  union of all permissions of the owning group, and all named user and group
  entries.  (These are exactly the entries affected by the mask entry).

--mask
  Valid in conjunction with -m.  Do recalculate the effective rights mask,
  even if an ACL mask entry was explicitly given. (See the -n option.)

-s, --set
  Like -f, but set the file's ACL with ACL entries specified in a
  comma-separated list on the command line.

While the -x and -m options may be used in the same command, the -f and -s
options may be used only exclusively.

Directories may contain default ACL entries.  Files created in a directory
that contains default ACL entries will have permissions according to the
combination of the current umask, the explicit permissions requested and
the default ACL entries.
